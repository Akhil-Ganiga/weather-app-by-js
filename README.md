The Weather App is a web-based application that provides real-time weather information for a specified location. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app allows users to enter a city or location name and retrieve current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other relevant data. JavaScript makes asynchronous requests to a weather API, such as OpenWeatherMap, to fetch weather data based on the user's input. The app dynamically updates the user interface with the retrieved weather information, displaying it in an easy-to-read format. This tool helps users plan their activities and stay informed about current weather conditions in any location worldwide.
